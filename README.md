# lfs-book-generator

I'm a lazy programmar, I want to make a stage 3 tarball with ease that is multilib, work in progress
This is best used on an ubuntu distro to setup - Kubuntu is recommended

Notes:
Working on lfs-book-generator-new.sh for testing on virtualbox

You will want to check chapter 4 real good, the "setup"

Will probably stick thru chapters 4-6 the rest is manual

To do
Test out on VirtualBox
